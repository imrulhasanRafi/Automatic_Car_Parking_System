# Automatic Car Parking System 🚗

An intelligent, automated parking management system designed to simplify vehicle entry and exit using **Arduino Uno**, **IR sensors**, and a **servo motor**. This system efficiently tracks parking availability and provides real-time updates to users.

---

## 🌟 Key Features
- **Automated Entry Control**: The gate automatically opens if parking slots are available.
- **Real-Time Parking Status**: Displays user-friendly messages like *"Welcome"* or *"Parking Full"* on an LCD screen.
- **Accurate Slot Monitoring**: Dynamically tracks the number of vehicles in the parking lot.
- **Capacity Management**: Prevents new entries when all parking slots are occupied.

## 🔧 Components Used

| **Component**      | **Functionality**                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Arduino Uno**     | Microcontroller for processing sensor inputs and managing the servo motor.        |
| **IR Sensors (x2)** | Detects vehicle presence at the gate and counts cars entering the parking lot.    |
| **Servo Motor**     | Operates the gate mechanism for controlled entry and exit.                        |
| **LCD Display**     | Provides real-time feedback on parking availability.                              |

## ⚙️ System Workflow

### 1. Vehicle Detection
- **IR Sensor 1**: Identifies when a vehicle approaches the parking gate.
- **Action**:
  - If parking slots are available, the gate opens, and a *"Welcome"* message is displayed on the LCD.
  - If no slots are available, the gate remains closed, displaying *"Parking Full."*

### 2. Parking Slot Monitoring
- **IR Sensor 2**: Tracks the number of vehicles entering the parking lot.
- The system dynamically updates available slots and prevents over-occupancy.

### 3. Gate Control
- A **servo motor** operates the gate mechanism, ensuring smooth opening and closing based on parking availability.
